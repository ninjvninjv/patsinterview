        <h4>
            What have you learned about yourself through painting as a mirror?
        </h4>
        
    <p>
    I feel like the answer to that is also in your question. <i>The act of painting does force you to look in the
        mirror, even when you don’t want to or when you’re trying to avoid that parallel.</i> I think with my practice,
especially the start of all my bodies of work, I really gravitate towards this surrealist exercise that’s called
automatic drawing. Most people aren’t familiar with it, but they’re more familiar with automatic writing.
Automatic writing is really just trying to clear your mind of anything preconceived—like the opposite of an
underpainting sort of mindset—and letting your hand work in a way where you have no plan.
For me, I’ll make a bunch of drawings like that, and paintings on paper, all different sorts of mixed mediums.
Then I’ll hang them all up on my wall or lay them out on the floor. I try to connect the dots a bit and see what
objects or symbolism are repeating and why. Most of the time, there is always some form of repetition. It’s
always very interesting because they’re ideas or objects that I wasn’t thinking about prior, or I didn’t think
were so impactful. The more I start working with them and taking them apart, the more I realize there are
connections to childhood experiences—ways in which certain objects represent something that feels half tapped
into my adolescence and half tapped into problems or experiences I’m thinking about today. A lot of that has
subconsciously led me into the bulk of where my practice is at now, which really teeters on the in-between space
between child and adult, or girl and woman. Finding the gaps in time and space that sort of represent those
feelings.
    </p> 
        
       <h4>
           When you’re engaging in automatic drawing or writing, does it feel like you’re having a conversation with your
           subconscious?
        </h4>
        
    <p>
Sort of. I think that’s why, when I start a new series or body of work, I’ve gotten into the routine of always
starting off by doing a bunch of those drawings. I don’t find them to be effective if you only have a couple of
them. What makes that process so special for me comes into play after the drawings are done. The drawings become
activated in a setting that is nonlinear, and all of the works on paper are in conversation with each other—they
act or react based on one another. If they were just singular pieces, they wouldn’t have the same impact at all.

        <h4> 
        How would you say nostalgia plays a role in your paintings as you uncover childhood memories and capture mundane
        moments?
        </h4>
        
    <p>
<i>Most of the experiences or settings I’m exploring are intentionally super mundane or banal. I’m not trying to
make a spectacle of any sort of experience or setting.</i> I realized that formally, or stylistically, my line work
can come across as if I’m representing figures in a way that’s a bit more “grotesque,” which is unintentional—
it’s just a little bit more raw. I have to be cautious of nostalgia, with the little details I include and with
the color palettes I use, to make it clear to the viewer that the people, ideas, and moments I’m depicting are
coming from a positive, reflective point. I’m not exploiting anyone or anything. It’s more of a reminiscence or a
point of reflection… I don’t want to say an “uplifting” canon, but yeah. Does that make sense?
    <p/>
        
        <h4>
        Yeah. Do you feel like nostalgia, or representing nostalgic memories, softens what you were describing as your
        more “grotesque” figuration?
        </h4>
        
    <p>    
That definitely helps. The pairing, or the duality of it, is a little unusual. But it helps bring all different
types of people back to a very specific moment in time. It’s really special to me.<i> I feel like my biggest
takeaway about success—and how I view other people’s art and my own artistic practice—is that if it makes you
feel something, regardless if that’s a positive or negative feeling, and evokes some sort of genuine emotion,
then that is the magic of it all. So I think nostalgia is a funny thing. It’s definitely a root of my practice,
and it goes a long way with my audience. Most people can understand that it’s coming from that source. It just
leads down many different paths.</i>
    </p>   
        
        <h4>
        What’s the moment like when a work is finished? Is it a knowing?
        </h4>
        
    <p>    
That’s tough. For me, the worst feeling in the world is overworking a painting. It’s something that I used to
struggle with a lot. That was also when I wasn’t valuing art as an experience over the final product. I thought,
the more detail and the more you buff something out [the better]. I couldn’t be farther from that side of the
spectrum now. When I think that a work is done, I will flip it over and start working on something else in
tandem. I’ll take a break before going back to it. I’ll give it a week, a couple of weeks, a month, whatever it
is, and just let it marinate and see how I feel. My preference, for most of the paintings that I’m a fan of,
always teeters more towards looking almost unfinished… Most of the time, for me, less is more and I don’t need to
overpack something to get my message across.

        <h4>
        What are you excited about?
        </h4>
        
    <p>    
I’m super excited about a popup exhibition at 40 Crosby Street in Soho at w/ Ward Community Arts Program opening
May 16th, and my next solo show in Rome at the end of April at T293 gallery. This body of work is called Shadow
Talk. I was thinking a lot about spotlights in a physical sense. Flashlights, people looking for things under
beds, dancers or performers kind of being forced on a platform in one way or another. Some of the drawings
weren’t metaphorical and they were [literal] performers, and then others were people in everyday life who feel
like they have to sort of perform or put on an act to be taken seriously. It got me thinking about the different
versions of ourselves that exist—sort of like skeletons in the closet or in relation to grieving—and how those
different versions of yourself can sort of come and go, but are still with you in everyday life.
