    <h4>
        Do you have any symbols or themes that have stood out to you as your favorites? Or the most shocking or most
        confronting in your work?
    </h4>
        
    <p>   
Over the past few years, I’ve noticed that one of the symbols I include quite often—which wasn’t pointed out
until somewhat recently during a studio visit—is this bunny rabbit character. I was gifted a bunny rabbit stuffed
animal after my mom gave birth to me, from one of her best friends: this really skinny, lanky, long-legged bunny
rabbit that I called Hop Hop. I still have him at my house on display. Hop Hop kind of appears in many of my
paintings. It’s interesting because he is a good example of something that’s a direct link to adolescence, or
youth, in a way that makes you do a double take and think.

    <h4>
        In reference to feeling clogged, I guess you’re talking about it in a positive sense, where you’re a channel for
        something larger. But have you ever felt stuck without an idea to work with? How do you nurture your inner artist
        and help the idea to come out?
    </h4>
    
    <p>   
I don’t ever feel stuck without an idea because I’m always working on multiple projects at once.<i> If I’m feeling
stuck formally with painting, or if I’m in a bit of a rut, I know myself well enough to take a break and seek
inspiration in other art forms. </i>I love to read, so I’ll pick up a book. I love to go to galleries and museums—
I’ll learn something through that. I’ll see a movie… <i>Just because you come to the studio every day, we’re not
robots. It doesn’t mean you’re going to generate things consistently. It’s really important to be self-aware and
know where you find inspiration. </i>
After most shows, I do take a break from painting. I’ll go on a little hiatus where I’ll get really into writing,
then drawing, and then I’ll go back to painting. It just depends. For this show [at T293 in Rome], the works are
so big. That was a really big challenge, using my whole body. After this, working very small will be even more
challenging, so I’m going to be working on these 10-by-10-inch wooden cube paintings. I think the duality of that
will be a nice push for me. We’ll see what comes out of it.

    <h4>
      You previously described your use of materials as “an intuitive act.” Have you always felt intuitive?
    </h4>
    
    <p>   
I have always considered myself to be an intuitive artist. I read this book while I was in grad school written by
the philosopher John Dewey, Art as Experience. The book talks about how he favors the experience of making
something over the final product. That really resonated with me. Going off that basis or guideline, <i>I should be
making work that really feeds me and makes me feel best. It’s different for everyone. For me, that’s definitely
being intuitive and mixing these types of materials that wouldn’t typically be layered or used together.</i> Were the
works I was making before grad school more technically advanced or complete? Yes, but that wasn’t fueling me. So
this is where I feel more comfortable—in this sort of process.
