    <h4>
      A lot of your motifs are centered around play as a kid. Does painting feel like play, or does it feel like work?
    </h4>
    
    <p>    
<i>Painting still feels like play, but in a way that holds more weight—a heavier type of play. As I get older, I
realize that because this is my job—even if I didn’t view it as a job in my eyes—I feel like it’s something that
I have to do. I have to get these ideas and thoughts out. It’s almost like my responsibility or moral duty to do
so. When I don’t, I feel clogged.</i> So, yes it does feel like play, but it feels like I have way more of a
responsibility now to my practice.
    </p>    
    
    <h4>
        How do you navigate the balance between art and commerce? How do you approach putting a dollar value behind your
        work?
    </h4>
    
    <p>   
I try not to think about those things while I’m in here [the studio]. Every artist is different, but I like to
stick to a pretty consistent formula that my mentor in grad school advised me on. I pretty much price things
consistently on their scale, and <i>I try not to let emotional attachment steer or disrupt any pricing.</i>
    </p>
    
    <h4>
        You mentioned grad school—during your MFA, you did a lot of archival work using photographs. I’m curious about
        your relationship between your various mediums of painting, drawing, illustration, etc.?
    </h4>
    
    <p>
My biggest takeaway from graduate school came from a critique class I had with Marilyn Minter, who’s an amazing
painter and photographer, and who also went to Syracuse. She really instilled in me that <i>anything you put on a
canvas, or anything you portray as a painting, is a painting.</i> When I first started grad school, I thought that to
be a painter, or to be taken seriously as a painter, I had to become more painterly: get super thick, only use
oil paints, and focus on my form, brushstrokes, and the heaviness of that. Honestly, I’m way better at drawing
than I am at painting. I enjoy drawing way more. That really serves me. I’ve fully embraced that self-awareness
and openly state how drawing is the root of my painting practice, but it is a painting practice. <i>Anyone who uses
paint is a painter. It’s all just up to you how you want to portray yourself. </i>I don’t think about the word
“illustration” anymore. Illustrating is like catering to someone else’s voice, idea, or needs, whereas drawing is
more tied to myself… But it’s all just verbiage.

    <h4>
        You’re following threads and making sense of your work kind of in reverse.
    </h4>
    
    <p>   
My work is so connected to my personal identity in a way that’s almost diaristic. It’s dealing with motifs,
ideas, and thoughts of everyday life given that specific period of time. A lot of it is just me trying to make
sense of the world, or my world, in really mundane, small ways. <i>I’m such a curious person. I’m just trying to
understand things, and this is my way of understanding or exploring certain ideas or narratives and seeing what
comes of it. I feel like I don’t have the answers to anything, but I’m just trying to work them out.</i>
    </p> 
    
    <h4>
        What’s the moment like when a work is finished? Is it a knowing?
    </h4>
    
    <p>    
That’s tough. <i>For me, the worst feeling in the world is overworking a painting. It’s something that I used to
struggle with a lot. That was also when I wasn’t valuing art as an experience over the final product. I thought,
the more detail and the more you buff something out [the better].</i> I couldn’t be farther from that side of the
spectrum now. <i> When I think that a work is done, I will flip it over and start working on something else in
tandem. I’ll take a break before going back to it. I’ll give it a week, a couple of weeks, a month, whatever it
is, and just let it marinate and see how I feel.</i> My preference, for most of the paintings that I’m a fan of,
always teeters more towards looking almost unfinished… Most of the time, for me, less is more and I don’t need to
overpack something to get my message across.
